# Careers

Visiting the oral surgeon can be scary for patients, but we are changing that. We are a team with ambition and heart. A team that works together and plays together. A team full of many strengths joining together to achieve one goal. Most importantly, we are a team with purpose, to fulfill the needs and exceed the expectations of each patient that walks through our doors.

At Precision Oral Surgery, the needs of the patient come first. Whether you are a scheduling coordinator creating a positive first impression when a patient calls, a treatment coordinator helping a patient understand their procedure options, a member of the clinical team caring for a patient first hand, or any other position, you are vital to our team. We believe in being friendly and outgoing, thoughtful and helpful, and working together for one goal - providing patients with an easy, calm, and positive experience.
