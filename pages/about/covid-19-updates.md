# COVID-19 Updates

We are currently seeing both emergency and elective procedures.&nbsp; We are following state mandates.

Here are our current office policies/updates:

* All patients will be required to wear a mask while in the building.&nbsp;
* Only one additional person is allowed to accompany the patient.
* Temperatures will be taken for all people entering the building.
* All patients and individuals accompanying patients will be asked COVID screening questions to determine the ability to remain in the building and/or proceed with surgery.
* We encourage everyone to practice social distancing while in the reception area.
* We recommend completing all your paperwork in advance to minimize the amount of time spent in our reception area.
* We are adjusting these guidelines as necessary.

We appreciate your help in making this a smooth transition. As our regulations change, we will be sure to keep you updated.

Precision Oral Surgery is continually monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the world at present.&nbsp; We are monitoring the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), American Dental Association (ADA), American Association of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS), our state dental societies, as well as other organizations for the latest and most up-to-date information regarding this disease and its potential impact on our patients and team members.&nbsp; These changes are quite fluid and we have made adjustments to our practice as mandated by these governing entities.

We are following the guidelines of only treating emergency patients.&nbsp; All elective procedures have been postponed.&nbsp; Our goal has always been that the “Needs of the Patient Come First”.&nbsp; We clearly continue to honor this, but must also act in the safest manner possible so as to minimize the threat of this disease and it’s spread to other patients, our staff and our communities.

Restriction of procedures, in regard to patient management, is an effort to mitigate this risk.&nbsp; Additionally, it allows conservation of valuable resources that may be more useful for patients requiring hospitalization and their respective healthcare providers managing their care.

We feel it is very important and support the governing bodies approach to continue to treat patients with emergent problems.&nbsp; This provides a valuable service by addressing the patient’s problem and keeping them out of the emergency room so that providers can focus care and resources on the patient’s suffering from COVID-19.&nbsp; Clearly this can have some degree of interpretation from both the patient and doctor perspective.&nbsp; Those patients that present with significant oral-facial pain, infection or potential for a significant alteration to their health, as it relates to these problems, will be evaluated and managed accordingly to our standard best practice.&nbsp; The treating doctor has the sole discretion to determine what would be best for each individual patient. Our team will continue to screen patients accordingly for known COVID-19 risk factors.&nbsp; We continually decontaminate all areas of the office and utilize the appropriate personal protective equipment during management of all emergent cases.

**3/14/20**

In light of the COVID-19 situation, we are following guidelines from the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies and the ADA. We are limiting patient encounters to those that have urgent needs. Patients at high risk are being re-scheduled. Other previously scheduled patients are being re-scheduled as necessary. Our office will remain open. Future elective procedures are currently being scheduled for mid-April and beyond. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.
