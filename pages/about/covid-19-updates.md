# COVID-19 Udpates

In light of the COVID-19 situation, we are following guidelines from the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies and the ADA. We are limiting patient encounters to those that have urgent needs. Patients at high risk are being re-scheduled. Other previously scheduled patients are being re-scheduled as necessary. Our office will remain open. Future elective procedures are currently being scheduled for mid-April and beyond. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.
